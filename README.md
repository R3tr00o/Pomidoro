Simple Pomodoro Website, not finished yet.

It is my first project build fully by myself with HTML,CSS and JS.
It helped me understand basics of building websites and interacting with them.
Acquired knowledge: 
- Working with DOM
- Async JS
- Semantic HTML

App contains bugs that I'm currently work on.

Features to add in future:
- Auto change session to break and vice versa.
- Sound when session and break is finished.
